# Eru

> Eru is the supreme deity of Arda. He was the single creator, above the Valar, but has delegated most direct action within EÃ¤ to the Ainur, including the shaping of the Earth (Arda) itself.


## Charges

Eru has become responsible for the following actions on Runnable:

* Docks, Customer Clusters
  * Quick views of Auto Scale Groups and memory usage
  * Ability to change Auto Scale Group sizes
  * Disable Auto Scale Groups (size to 0)
* Services
  * Provide overview of deployed versions in infrastructure
* Users
  * Moderation
  * Adding to the whitelist
  * Disabling accounts
  * Removing accounts

## Development

### Requirements

This entire project uses Babel to transform a lot of the ES6 code. While one can get away with any version of Node, it is _highly_ recommended that Node `4` or better is used along with npm `3` or better. npm `3` has fixes to do better dependency duplication handling as well as an improved (IMO) shrinkwrap function.

To get all the npm modules, `npm install` will do nicely.

### npm shrinkwrap

This project _does_ have an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file to maintain consistency

### User Data

In order to make everything function correctly, it is required that you provide a stub of your GitHub user to the development server. This stub is located in `test/fixtures/user-data.js`, and should include the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  id: githubID, // an integer
  username: 'githubUsername',
  accessToken: 'accessToken' // GitHub token w/ org:read access
}
```

### Services

To get services up and running for working with Eru, install Docker for Mac (the native one) and run the following:

```bash
npm run start:dev-services
npm run seed-database
```

This will spin up a container each for Redis, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and Consul, and then populate them with some basic data to give Eru basic functionality.

### Frontend

To work on the frontend, you simply need to build the GraphQL scheme once and then run the development server.

```bash
npm run build:schema
NODE_ENV=development npm run start:dev-server
```

Open http://localhost:5501/app in your browser. Any changes made to the React application (`app/*`) will be automatically built and the application refreshed.

This _is_ a React application: having the React toolkit extension installed in Chrome will make your life easier.

### Backend

To make changes to the backend, specifically making changes to the data layer, you will need to constantly rebuild the schema - it does not automatically rebuild. The following makes things a little quicker when restarting the server:

```bash
# make changes to `data/*`
npm run build:schema && NODE_ENV=development npm run start:dev-server
```

### Testing

Currently, the only tests that are enforced are the following:

1. `npm run lint` must pass - it uses `standard`
1. `npm run build` must pass - it builds the schema and frontend webpack
